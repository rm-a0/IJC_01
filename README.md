# Overview
This project contains 2 main programs: no-comment.c and primes.c \
no-comment.c is used for removing C/C++ like comments from files using finite state machine. \
primes.c is optimized Eratosthenes Sieve that uses custom bitset library. \
error.h and error.c are custom libraries for printing errors. \
eratosthenes.h and eratosthenes.c are files with seieve implementation that uses functions from bitset.h library. 
# How to use
To compile everything you can use command make all from Makefiile.
If you want to compile only some files use
<pre>
  make <name-of-file>
</pre>
